<h1>You found the secret invite!</h1>
<p>Wow, this invitation is much uglier than the rest of the site. That&apos;s because it&apos;s just a big waste of Reilly&apos;s time when he&apos;s supposed to be making the actual website.</p>
<p>Anyway, congratulations! Put your name here, and Reilly will drink a nice Scotch with you:
<form action="secretrsvp" method="POST">
	<input id="secret_name" name="secret_name"></input>
	<button type="submit" onclick="alert('Thanks!');">Submit</button>
</form>
</html>
